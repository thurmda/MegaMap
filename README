MegaMap is an unfinished project that was intended to be an interesting 
visualization of a geo-tagged content feed (i.e. twitter, youtube, your stuff) 

This project has become stale but there is some stuff in here that others may 
find useful so I'm placing it on GitHub as is. I'm happy to pick it up again 
or respond to inqueries if there is interest.  


Client requirements: Google Chrome, Google Earth Plugin
The code does dependency sniffing for these.

The Google Earth/Maps APIs require a key registered to the domain on which you 
will consume services. Use of a key mismatched with a domain will result in 
browser warnings, repeated use may result blocked access to the APIs. The key 
in the code is mine. I may get around to abstracting this into a config 
file as part of a build process but for now this works for me. 

You'll need to get a key here: http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html
and change it in your html when running this code on your domain

<script src="http://www.google.com/jsapi?key=<YOUR KEY>" type="text/javascript"></script>


You can see my cheesey demo instance here: http://danielthurman.com/megamap/

The SPA folder contains the Single Page Application that contains static files 
for the client side UI. The checked in code references a test data feed that 
does not rely on the Data Server.   

<script src="js/Feed Samples.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

The DataServer directory contains a node.js project that tails file out to 
websocket connections. The code assumes you'll be placing JSON formatted objects
representing feed items on each line. Feel free to append to the file however you 
wish. There is a bash script in the project that feeds some test data.

Code contained here is designed to run on a node.js enabled server. 
You should run tail2socket.js to set up the WebSockets and then use various
means to append data to the feed.

i.e.

./testData.sh MegaMapFeed 5 & 

This will spawn a background process that will append test data to 
MegaMapFeed every 5 seconds

node tail2socket.js MegaMapFeed 8000 &
This will spawn a background process that tails the MegaMapFeed file out to 
WebSocket clients connected on port 8000
